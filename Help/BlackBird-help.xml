          First Contact with Blackbird
          Now you are sitting in the Pilot cockpit
          On the Forward Cockpit if Blackbird   SR71-A
          With view "7" you can see the RSO cockpit (not yet with equipemnts)
          On the Rear Cockpit if Blackbird   SR71-B  training
          With view "7" you can see the Pilot Student cockpit
          The Electric Master is OFF
          The Engines is "cut off" ON
          The canopy are "open"
          The Parking Brake is ON

          ====Start Routine==========
          Electric Master Switch On => key "}"
          Get the external Starter ressources  with "s" key
          The engine will spin up to a maximum of about %25 N2 (%5.2 N1)
          This simulates the action of the external starter.
          After reaching %15 N2,  Cutoff to False  => key "{"
            wait for the EP Ratio needle close to 1.1
          Don't forget to close the canopy key => "d"
          Parking brake Off
          then push the throttle to  take off
          
          Run on ground until 180 kts take off  before 210 kts 
          ( above you will damage the tyres)
         
          ====To get 85000 feets=======
          After take Off and Landing gear UP, set the trottle to maximum and
          Step 1  =>set the Autopilot "Pitch Hold" to 10
                       =>Climb until 33000 ft , you shoul be at 1.09mach
          Step 2  =>Then descent at 30,000 ft , you will be at 1.15 Mach
          Step 3  => Now you can climb at 65000 and getting 2.30 Mach ( not less)
         Step 4   => Then you may now climb to cruise speed and altitude 
         3.2 Mach 85000 ft
         Beware:
         You will never get the right thrust, if you don't get 1.15  Mach above 28000 ft
         Recommendation:
         these operations will be easier when you are using  the autopilot
         Step 1  "Pitch Hold" to 10 and then "Altitude Hold 33000"
         Step 2  Altitude 30000
         Step 3 Altitude 65000
         Step 4 Altitude 85000
         
          ====Refueling============
          ONLY  On gound refueling, if Airspeed less than 20 kts
          With Hotspot on Panel => transferswitch LMB => ON or MMB => OFF

          ONLY Air refueling if Airspeed more than 200 kts and Agl more  than 300 feet
          With Hotspot on Panel => transfer switch LMB => ON or MMB => OFF
                AND
          With "F" Key which open the Doors

          the braking chute will be released, untied
          When
          Airspeed less than 60 kts
          REMEMBER       it can be used only once
          If you want it again you must reload it =>  key "j"

          ====Radar================

          The autopilot can be ON/OFF with Altitude and Heading
           with key => "Ctrl A"  (toggle ON/OF) for the current Altitude
        <!--  with key => "Ctrl H"  (toggle ON/OF) for the choosen bug heading on your HSI instrument    -->
